              Saraya, located in eastern Senegal near the borders with Mali and Guinea, lies within the Birimian Greenstone Belt—an 
              area of intense gold exploration and mining activity. The region hosts both large-scale industrial operations and numerous
              artisanal mining sites, which have expanded rapidly in recent years. While the sector supports local livelihoods, it also 
              places growing pressure on surface and groundwater resources through increased water abstraction, sedimentation, and 
              contamination. The area's crystalline basement geology and limited perennial surface water make groundwater the primary
              source for drinking, domestic use, and small-scale processing. Understanding its distribution and vulnerability has become
              central to sustainable resource management.

                area of intense gold exploration and mining activity. The region hosts both large-scale industrial operations and

                <p>
                The Saraya fieldwork was carried out during the late dry season, under conditions of high temperature, dust, and limited 
                infrastructure. Access to remote mining zones required coordination with local authorities, community representatives, 
                and concession managers to ensure safe operations. Field teams installed long-term groundwater monitoring equipment and 
                collected complementary datasets including manual water levels, field EC/pH readings, and soil and sediment samples. 
                These observations were supported by targeted tTEM and ERT profiles designed to assess aquifer depth and potential zones 
                of mine-related recharge or contamination.

                Work in Saraya combined near-surface geophysical imaging, field monitoring, and local engagement. Continuous tTEM and ERT
                 profiles were used to delineate weathered zones, fracture corridors, and potential groundwater pathways around active 
                 mining areas. Groundwater monitoring stations were established in community wells and exploration boreholes to track 
                 seasonal variations in water levels and conductivity. Laboratory analyses of selected samples assessed key parameters 
                 including total dissolved solids, trace metals, and redox conditions. The data were compiled into an integrated 
                 geodatabase to support both local water authorities and ongoing environmental compliance programs

                <h3 class="major">Outcomes and relevance</h3>
                <p>
                The Saraya campaign provided a clearer picture of how mining activities intersect with local hydrogeological systems in
                 eastern Senegal. By combining resistivity mapping with continuous water-level and quality monitoring, the work helped 
                 identify vulnerable zones and potential pathways for contaminant migration. The findings contribute to a growing regional
                  dataset supporting responsible mining practices and groundwater protection. Beyond technical outcomes, the monitoring 
                  program established a foundation for long-term collaboration between research institutions, mining operators, and 
                  regulatory bodies—advancing evidence-based water management in one of Senegal’s most dynamic extractive regions.

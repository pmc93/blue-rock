# Case Studies

Real-world examples of our work in action:

## Coastal Aquifer Characterization – Senegal
Used joint TEM and NMR methods to support saltwater intrusion modeling.

## Urban Recharge Assessment – Denmark
Integrated remote sensing, borehole data, and ERT to evaluate recharge zones in urban catchments.

## Wetland Function & Redox Dynamics – South Africa
Combined geochemical monitoring and geophysics to model wetland-groundwater interactions.

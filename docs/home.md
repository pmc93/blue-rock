## Welcome to Edcrop

This is a test!

Edcrop is a Python package for simulating evapotranspiration and drainage from a field on the basis of 
climatic data and builds off of the Evacrop program ([Olesen and Heidmann, 2002](https://www.yumpu.com/da/document/view/17948798/evacrop-et-program-til-beregning-af-aktuel-fordampning-og-)).

It makes several important improvements to the Evacrop program in that it can also simulate for forests and wetlands.

Edcrop is short for “Evapotranspiration and Drainage from CROP, wetland, or forest”.
